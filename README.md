# data_models_for_cancer_treatments
The dataset used in above analysis is that of Ovarian cancer and I am using human gene exression for my analysis.
I am trying to understand if any of those genes stand out in cancer patients and if they do, what's their role.
Various techniques like pca, correlation analysis and all the way to recurrent neural networks have been used to identify genes which can be responsible for tumor mutation in patients. Every notebook contains explanation of the methods, I am using.
